# My Node.js and MongoDB Application

This is a simple Node.js application with MongoDB for user authentication and management.

## Features

- User registration and login
- User profile management
- Rate limiting for API requests
- Session management
- Error handling

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Node.js and npm installed
- MongoDB installed and running
- Configuration set up in a `.env` file

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-project.git
   cd your-project
   
2. Next, install the project dependencies using npm (Node Package Manager). Run the following command:
    ```bash
    npm install
   
   This will download and install all the required packages and modules specified in the package.json file.

3. **Configure MongoDB**

   The project relies on MongoDB as its database. You'll need to set up a MongoDB database and configure the connection URL in the project.

   - If you don't have MongoDB installed locally, you can install it by following the instructions on the [MongoDB website](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/).

   - Once MongoDB is installed, you can create a new database and obtain the connection URL.

   - Update the MongoDB connection URL in the server.js file in your project directory. Look for the following line and replace it with your database URL:

     # javascript
     mongoose.connect('mongodb+srv://hemuchauhan31:zwKAXyQOzdvPGqm8@cluster0.yxwdhvj.mongodb.net/', { useNewUrlParser: true, useUnifiedTopology: true });

4. **Start the Server**

   After configuring the database, you can start the server by running the following command:

   ```bash
   npm run start

    This command will start the Node.js server, and you should see a message indicating that the server is running on a specific port (e.g., Server is running on port 3000).
